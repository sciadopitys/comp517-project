# Comp517 Midterm

Written midterm report for the project that states the
problem you will address, the motivation for why it is an
interesting problem, the goal of your project, the
relationship between your project and other work, the plan
and methodology for your project, and the results of your
exploration. 

## Assignment Requirements

You will write a proposal with the following high level
sections:

1. Introduction
2. Background
3. Methods and Plan
4. Evaluation and Results
5. Discussion and Lessons Learned
6. Conclusion

The midterm should be no longer than 8 pages. Each major
section is described below. 

**Note that the outline is given only as a starting point
and that you can use a different form.** The point is that
this outline is formative in stating what is expected,
however, you've read many papers with various degrees of
these elements being explicitly presented.

### Introduction

You will write an introduction with the following key points
(closely related to the [Seven Key
Questions](../resources/seven-questions.pdf)). These
questions mirror the research questions you expect to pull
out of any original scholarly work. Each of these should be
approximately 1-2 paragraphs. The following sections will
provide elaboration of these elements.

1. Problem + why it's important
2. Research context or gap in existing approaches
3. The aim/goal/hypothesis (typically a single sentence, but
   can be longer)
4. The proposed solution: how will you solve it?
5. How you will evaluate it?
6. Anticipated Contributions

### Background

Detail a few specific elements of the problem that are
necessary to understand the work. This can be an expanded
version of the problem as mentioned in the introductory
paragraph. 

### Design (Methods) of the Approach

Detail the early design of the solution.

### Evaluation

How do you evaluate your hypothesis? What did you do? What
were the results? 

## Grading Rubric

The proposal will be evaluated in the same way that each
research paper we read is. Key elements will include
analysis of whether the report cearly articulates:

1. the problem and its importance, 
2. related work and justifies the niche of the work, 
3. a novel hypothesis (claim about the method/idea to
   solve), 
4. a method for demonstrating the hypothesis, 
5. a feasible and strong evaluation, 

The proposal will receive equal weighting for the above
elements. I will also grad with regard to clarity of
writing, but will place less emphasis here, however, note
that to clearly describe those points you must have clear
writing.

You will also be graded on the development of your system
and results. For this deadline, I expect to see some
numbers, computation, evidence of a working systems that
does something.
